# CppLeastCommonMultiple

## Overview
This repository hosts a C++ program designed to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers. The program employs the Euclidean algorithm to first determine the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and then uses it to find the LCM.

## Getting Started
To run this program, you will need a C++ compiler. The steps below outline how to compile and execute the program:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mht83/CppLeastCommonMultiple.git
2. Change into the repository directory:
cd CppLeastCommonMultiple
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler like g++:
g++ -o LCM main.cpp
4. Execute the program:
./LCM

## Program Details
The user is prompted to input two integers. The program then outputs the LCM of these numbers. It demonstrates the use of functions, loops, and conditional statements in C++.
